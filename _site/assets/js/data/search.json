    "content": "The signage solution we have in place has served us well but it is time for an update. The original open source developer of the solution has taken their poject project proprietary as well.We will be developing the new solution as open source and will use already available code whenever possible: don’t reinvent the wheel.  Unless you have to, that is.New FeaturesThis time around we will be adding some new features:  Users will be able to login to server to manage their digital signs centrally.  Each sign can be included in a group or managed separately. Each sign in a group will play the same slideshow.  Users will be able to upload images and create playlists on the server, and then assign them to the digital signs.  Users wil be able to schedule playlist changes by individual signs or as groups.  Each digital signage device will not be required to host the slideshow: they will receive their assigned content from a server. Each time a device reaches the end of the assigned playlist, it will check for content changes.  Screensavers for the Mac, Windows, and Linux will be availale and will be managed the same as digital signs.  In addition to playlists for digital signs, users will be able to created hosted Kiosks and Presentations.DocumentationProject Documentationis availabe online as are our starting templates."

    "content": "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git has been around since 2005 and is widely used for collaborative software development.  But it has wider uses.  As examples it is used by writers and artists to track changes as it keeps a complete history and changes can be rolled back to any point.  You can grant access to your projects and allow others to submit changes: those changes can be reviewed by the owner and merged, rejected, or a separate branch created.Even if you just use Git to track your own changes to your work (articles for publication, photographs - any electronic work) the benefits are considerable and it is worth your time to take a look at the information below.Learn how you can use GitHub to host a personal website for free.

    "content": "Over the past two years years Microsoft has made some significant improvements to the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of the Windows operating system that enables you to run a Linux file system, along with Linux command-line tools and GUI apps, directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and apps. WSL 2 is a new version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture, available beginning with Windows 10-Version 1903-Build 18362, that powers the Windows Subsystem for Linux to run ELF64 (Executable and Linkable Format) Linux binaries on Windows. WSL2 provides a truly great resource for developers and application testing.(WSL), Windows Subsystem for Linux, allows you to install Linux distros on your Windows 10 or 11 machine without the need for a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly from Windows.  You can install multiple Linux distros such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and Oracle Linux, and have them running at the same time.Ubuntu is the default Linux distro in WSL, but you can change the default distro that is installed. Ubuntu offers a set of tutorials specifically for using the distro in WSL. The tutorials are in text and video.WSL 2 is only available for Windows 10, Version 1903, Build 18362 or later.  If you are running a compatible version of Windows 10, you will need to update your version of WSL. Windows 11 was released with WSL 2 installed.To get started, visit the Microsoft website for WSL2.Some improvements in WSL2:  Uses a full Linux kerel.  Support for full system call compatibility.  Faster boot time and improved performance.  GNU\\Linux graphical applications can be run directly from Windows.  Improved file system performance.  Use GPU acceleration for machine learning and data science.A thorough comparison of WSL 1 and WSL 2 is available on the Microsoft website.Linux Foundation offers a free training course if you are new to Linux or need a refresher.
