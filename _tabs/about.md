On the site you will find information intended for a wide audience: faculty researchers, students, and IT professionals. Articles are written by me, and generally provide an introduction to a topic with everything needed to get started quickly. Posts may be tutorials, provide an introduction to a topic, or provide a description of an application or service and that includes related links.  

The main goal of the website is to provide a resource for colleagues.
