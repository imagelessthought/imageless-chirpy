[Git](https://git-scm.com 'Git Website') is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git has been around since 2005 and is widely used for collaborative software development.  But it has wider uses.  As examples it is used by writers and artists to track changes as it keeps a complete history and changes can be rolled back to any point.  You can grant access to your projects and allow others to submit changes: those changes can be reviewed by the owner and merged, rejected, or a separate branch created.

Even if you just use Git to track your own changes to your work (articles for publication, photographs - any electronic work) the benefits are considerable and it is worth your time to take a look at the information below.

Learn how you can use GitHub to [host a personal website for free](https://pages.github.com 'GitHub Pages website'). This is an excellent way to learn to use Git and you get a free website as well.

[GitHub](https://github.com 'GitHub Website') is free as long as you keep your [repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories 'Git Repositories') public.  If you want to have private repositories, you would have to upgrade to Pro (just under $4 a month as of June 1, 2023).  However, GitHub does offer [free plans for students and instructors](https://education.github.com/benefits 'Free GitHub for Educational Use').  Encourage your students to take advantage of this offer and also apply for the free Student Developer Pack. The [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack 'GitHub Student Pack') contains tools are services that would otherwise be quite costly.

[GitHub](https://github.com 'GitHub Website') is very popular but there are other options available: [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com 'Gitlab Website') and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org 'Bitbucket Website').
